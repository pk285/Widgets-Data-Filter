# My Success Criteria
<br>
To add to the success criterias, I would add:
<br>
Let users contact selected employee via email.
<br>
The reason: 
<br>
If this is an employee database, then it would be great if one could contact the employee by sending an email. Eventaully, it can be more complex like connect with them on social media, etc... but email is a great start.
